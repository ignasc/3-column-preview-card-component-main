## My process

### Built with

- HTML5 and CSS
- Flex box
- Visual Studio Code software

### What I learned

As I am learning to code, it helps me to visualy see the all the element boundaries, where they are for all those flex boxes, grids etc. And instead of adding a border color to every element, I found "one line to color them all".
```css
html * {
    border: 1px solid red;
}
```
Another great lesson I learned and reinforcing as a good practice: mobile design first as it is much simpler.

### Continued development

Fitting items inside a flex container is still a bit of a struggle.
Centering elements horizontaly and especially vertically is a challenge in certain situations, when I want to keep certain minimum distance from the edge of a window and centered at the same time.
